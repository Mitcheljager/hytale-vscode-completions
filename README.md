# VSCode Completions for Hytale

VSCode extension that provides completions for Hytale related things.

## Current features
- Autocomplete for Item names and/or IDs, names matching into IDs
- Hover documentation for Item IDs, showing the in-game text
- Schema for .json files in Items/Item

## Planned features
- More schemas for all .json file types (different schemas for all .json files in Server/*)
- More completions than just item names
- Matching icons for each item

## Requirements
The extension is initialized in all projects that have a manifest.json file and a Server or Common folder anywhere in your project. Alternatively you can add an empty .hytale file in your project and it will initialize regardless.
